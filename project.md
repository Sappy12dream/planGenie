### 🚀 **PlanGenie — Your AI Planning Copilot**

**Problem:**

Planning anything — a trip, a wedding, a project, or even a presentation — takes hours of research, organizing, and tracking. Most tools are rigid checklists that don’t adapt to what you’re planning.

**Solution:**

**PlanGenie** is an AI-powered planner that *thinks and organizes for you*.

You just tell it *what you’re planning* — and it:

* Generates a complete, structured plan with timelines and resources

* Tracks your progress interactively

* Lets you upload proofs (tickets, docs, screenshots)

* Chats with you to modify, verify, or suggest next steps

**Examples:**

* “Plan my Goa trip for 5 days” → itinerary, bookings, packing list

* “Plan my wedding shopping” → category-wise checklist, budget tracker

* “Plan a new app build” → project roadmap, task board, resource links

**Why It Wins:**

* Works for *any* type of plan — personal or professional

* Turns abstract goals into concrete, actionable steps

* Integrates AI + task tracking + verification in one experience

**Tech Stack:**

Frontend: Next.js

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Database: Supabase (Postgres)

AI Layer: OpenAI + LangChain

**Vision:**

To become the **universal planning agent** — the one app that can plan, track, and manage anything you imagine.
